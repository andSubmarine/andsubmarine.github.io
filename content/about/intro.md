# About Me

My name is **Andreas Blanke** and I am a <years-old-span></years-old-span> year-old Danish software engineer living on Amager in Copenhagen. I would typically describe myself as a *wholesome bearded guy* with *Jutlandic Charm™* and *Fynsk 'hygge'*.

## Academics

I completed my Master’s Degree in Computer Science at the [IT-University of Copenhagen](http://itu.dk) (ITU) in 2021. In 2019, I also finished my Bachelor Degree in Software Development from ITU. The reason why I choose an education from ITU was because I wanted a broad software development education that offered insights into all aspects of the software development lifecycle and ITU provided could provide me such a toolbox. At ITU I chose to specialize with courses in *Data Systems*, *Computer Systems Performance*, *Android Development*, *Software Architecture*, *Security* and *Machine Learning*.

## Professional

I am currently employed at [Netcompany](https://www.netcompany.com/) where I have worked first as an Analyst (during my Masters), Consultant and then finally as a Software Architect. Through my professional career then I have gained a lot of experience in a variety of aspects in the software development cycle.

As an Analyst, I primarily worked with prototyping front-end applications using web development frameworks like [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) as well as responsive libraries like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

As a Consultant, I was responsible for the development of several important backend services in a large-scale microservice platform for digital communication in the form of digital post. I was part of that project from its earliest days and helped guide, develop, and mature the platform as we reached deadlines, went live, and increased the reach of the platform to thousands of customers and millions of end-users.

Over the time of the project, I became a very valued employee due to: 1) my ability to think holistically and see the bigger picture, 2) my ability to analyse complex requirements and contraints and resolve problems quickly, 3) my level of technical expertise gained through education and experience, 4) my ability to create abstractions of complex problems and communicate them effectively, 5) my ability to collaborate with various stateholders and project participants, and finally 6) my ability to identify and assess potential risks and determine mitigation strategies.

In recognition to being identified as a high-value performing employee then I was promoted to the title of Senior Architect where I continued to work on the project in a leadership position as a Tech Lead and Software Architect.

## Hobbies

Some of my other interests include Dungeons and Dragons (*i.e. plotting the doom of my players*), baking (*mostly with sourdough*) and good coffee (*I have a cubboard full of coffee beans*). Don't tell my roommate, but I'm also working on slowly filling the apartment with rubber ducks and plants.
