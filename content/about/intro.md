My name is **Andreas Blanke** and I am a 24 year-old Danish software engineer living on Amager in Copenhagen. I would typically describe myself as a *wholesome bearded guy* with *Jutlandic Charm™* and *Fynsk 'hygge'*.
 
### Academics
I am currently working on a Master’s Degree in Computer Science at the [IT-University of Copenhagen](http://itu.dk) (ITU). In 2019, I also finished my Bachelor Degree in Software Development from ITU. The reason why I choose an education from ITU was because I wanted a broad software development education that offered insights into all aspects of the software development lifecycle and ITU provided could provide me such a toolbox. At ITU I have chosen to specialize with courses in *Computer Systems Performance*, *Android Development*, *Software Architecture*, *Security* and *Machine Learning*.

### Professional
I am currently employed at [Netcompany](https://www.netcompany.com/) where I work as an Analyst on some very interesting projects. Web and Android development are some of my primary skills by which I am experienced in programming languages such as Java, web development frameworks such as [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) / [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) & [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), and responsive libraries such as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). I also have a keen interest in data systems, performance analysis, web security, agile methodologies & processes, and software architecture.

### Hobbies
Some of my other interests include Dungeons and Dragons (*i.e. plotting the doom of my players*), baking (*mostly with sourdough*) and good coffee (*I have a cubboard full of coffee beans*). Don't tell my roommate, but I'm also working on slowly filling the apartment with rubber ducks and plants.
